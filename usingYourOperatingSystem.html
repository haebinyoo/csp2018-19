    <h2>Checkpoint 1: Which Version?</h2>
    <p>First, press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Windows-X</span> on your keyboard. A menu should appear in the lower-left corner of your screen.
        Choose System. This will bring up your computer's information. See if you can find the name of your operating system.
        If nothing happened when you pressed Windows-X, then click the Windows icon at the lower-left corner of your screen.
        On the right-hand side of the Start Menu you'll see Computer as one of the choices. Right-click on it and select
        Properties. You should be able to see the <i>edition</i> of your operating system.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint.</p>

    <h2>Checkpoint 2: Lock and Unlock</h2>
    <p>To lock your computer, press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Windows-L</span>. This will immediately lock the computer. Then log back in by
        pressing <span class="keyboardShortcut">CTRL-ALT-Delete</span>.</p>
    <p>Go to the Start Menu and click on the small icon of a person. You should see an option to lock your computer. Choose
        it and then unlock the computer again.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint.</p>

    <h2>Checkpoint 3: Sleep and Wake</h2>
    <p>Sleep is just a term we use to describe computers that are in a low-power mode that allows them to be used quickly.
        When you press the power button on your phone to turn off the screen, it is in sleep mode. Go to the Start Menu and
        find the option labeled Sleep under your power options. Press it and see what happens. Then move the cursor or press
        a key to wake it back up.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint.</p>

    <h2>Checkpoint 4: Shutdown and Startup</h2>
    <p>To completely power down your computer, go to the Start Menu and choose Shut Down. Your computer should be completely
        powered off within a few seconds. Then how do you turn it back on? If your computer was completely frozen, meaning
        that it won't respond to you, you can force it to shut down by holding down the power button for several seconds.
        However, this is never a good idea if your computer isn't frozen. Always shut down the computer by choosing Shut
        Down from the Start Menu.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint.</p>

    <h2>Checkpoint 5: Restart</h2>
    <p>Now, go to the Start Menu and choose Restart. Your computer should shut down and then start back up on its own without
        you doing anything. </p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint.</p>

    <h2>Checkpoint 6: What's Going On?</h2>
    <p>If your computer is running slowly or you think there is something wrong, it is a good idea to check the Task Manager.
        Right-click on the taskbar and choose Task Manager. Then click More Details to expand it and see more information.</p>
    <p>Try the different tabs and see what you can learn about your computer from this tool. Then go online and see if you
        can find out what keyboard shortcut brings up the Task Manager.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint.</p>

    <h2>Checkpoint 7: The Taskbar</h2>
    <p>You've already used the Taskbar several times, but now it's time to learn what the different parts do. At the far
        left you should have the Start Menu. At the far right edge is a small button. Click it and see what happens. Now
        press each button on the Taskbar (except for the applications) and see what they do. Then right-click on the Taskbar
        and try the different options.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint.</p>

    <h2>Checkpoint 8: Common Shortcuts</h2>
    <p>Windows has several modifier keys. They change the behavior of the other keys on your keyboard although the Windows
        key also works all by itself.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Shift â‡§</li>
        <li>Caps Lock</li>
        <li>Ctrl</li>
        <li>Alt</li>
        <li>Windows (usually looks like the Start Menu icon)</li>
        <li>Fn</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You should know each of the modifier keys and be able to press the right one when asked. <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/198122/32-new-keyboard-shortcuts-in-the-windows-10-technical-preview/">This
            article contains the most important shortcuts for Windows 10.</a> Try each of them out and make sure you know
        what they do. One of the most important shortcuts is <span class="keyboardShortcut">Alt-Tab</span> for switching between windows. You must
        learn to use this instead of the mouse. Once you're done you will be asked to try several at random. Once you can
        do at least five from memory you'll be able to move on. If you're using an older version of Windows your shortcuts
        will be slightly different.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.vim.org/about.php">Vim</a> is one of the text editors that's installed on many Unix-based
        systems. It is mode-based, which seems unusual at first. It has two primary modes: command mode and insert
        mode. Command mode is used for editing text, which insert mode is used for writing text. We are used to
        modeless editors where you can do both at any time.</p>

    <p>The first thing you should do is <a href="http://vim-adventures.com">try out a game called VIM Adventures</a>.
        This introduces basic Vim commands, and especially teaches you to use the h, j, k, and l keys for navigating in
        Vim. Keep playing until you finish Level 1 before moving on to the next tutorial. You can complete the game
        later if you want.</p>

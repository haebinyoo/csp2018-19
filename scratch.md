# Writing in Markdown

Markdown is a markup system originally developed by John Gruber.
According to his website:

> Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown
> allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text
> format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).
>
> Thus, “Markdown” is two things: (1) a plain text formatting syntax;
> and (2) a software tool, written in Perl, that converts the plain text
> formatting to HTML. See the Syntax page for details pertaining to
> Markdown’s formatting syntax. You can try it out, right now, using the
> online Dingus.
>
> The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make
> it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted
> document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking
> like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While
> Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML
> filters, the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s
> syntax is the format of plain text email.

Markdown is used by many developers and writers, and it's a tool you'll
use throughout this year, especially in GitHub. You should keep your
Markdown reference card handy while you complete this lesson.

## Checkpoint 1: Markdown Tutorial

Complete all eight lessons in the [Markdown
Tutorial](http://www.markdowntutorial.com/).

    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint. Alternatively, you may record your screen as you
        complete each step from this checkpoint and submit the videos for credit.</p>

## Checkpoint 2: txti

Although you can use any text editor to write Markdown, not all editors
can preview what it will look like when you're ready to print or
publish. So we will use a web service that will let you see the results
quickly so you can make changes and correct mistakes.

Go to [txti.es](http://txti.es/) in another tab. This website allows you
to publish extremely simple pages online using Markdown. In the text
box, type in the following text, including the blank lines:

```
# This is a heading

This is a paragraph. Paragraphs are awesome.

You can start a new paragraph by leaving a blank line

between lines of text.

If you don't leave a blank line
the next line will be a part of the same paragraph.
```

Your screen should look like this when you are done:

![](images/firefox_2016-09-29_11-53-50.png){width="800" height="571"}

Go ahead and press Save and done. On the next screen it will ask you
for your email. Type in your school email address and click "Email the
below info. Then open the page you just created by clicking the
viewing link.

## Checkpoint 3: Italics and Bold

Go to the edit link for your page by adding `/edit` at the end of the
URL and pressing Enter. Make the first sentence of the first paragraph
italicized by putting underscores (the \_ character) on either side of
it. Make the second sentence of the first paragraph bold by putting two
asterisks (the \* character) on either side of it. Scroll to the bottom
of the page and put in your edit code that was emailed to you. Then
press Save and done.

        complete each step from this checkpoint and submit the videos for credit.</p>

## Checkpoint 4: Lists

Go to the edit link for your page by adding `/edit` at the end of the
URL and pressing Enter. Add an ordered list (a list that is numbered) of
five items to your website. Remember to put the number at the very
beginning of the line, followed by a period and a space. It's better to
start each list item with a `1. ` so that you can rearrange them later
without having to change the numbers.

Then create an unordered list (a list that uses bullet points) of five
items to your website. Remember to start each line with an asterisk and
a space. Scroll to the bottom of the page and put in your edit code that
was emailed to you. Then press Save and done.

## Checkpoint 5: Blockquotes

Go to the edit link for your page by adding `/edit` at the end of the
URL and pressing Enter. Whenever you quote text from another source in a
web page, you should use the blockquote tag. In Markdown, we indicate
the start of a blockquote with the &gt; symbol. Copy this paragraph into
your page and add the &gt; symbol and a space at the beginning of the
paragraph. Scroll to the bottom of the page and put in your edit code
that was emailed to you. Then press Save and done.

*If the quote doesn't appear indented and you can see the &gt; symbol,
that means there is a problem with txti, not your Markdown formatting.
This isn't something you can fix, so you can move on to the next
checkpoint.*

## Checkpoint 6: Links and Images

Go to the edit link for your page by adding `/edit` at the end of the
URL and pressing Enter. To create a link to another page, you surround
the text you want linked with \[ and \] and the actual link with ( and
). Create a link to this page in your website.

To add images, we use the same syntax as with links, except you put a `!`
in front of the \[link text\] to tell the computer it is an image, not a
traditional link. Go ahead and copy the link to the picture in
Checkpoint 2 and then insert it into your website. Scroll to the bottom
of the page and put in your edit code that was emailed to you. Then
press Save and done.

## Study Tips

1.  Practice writing in Markdown until you know the basics you studied -
    especially links and images - in this lesson by memory.
2.  Dedicated Markdown editors like
    [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/editor) can help you see changes
    that you make in real time if you need more practice.

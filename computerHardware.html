    <p>All computers rely on some sort of hardware in order to run programs and operating systems. This lesson will
        give you a basic understanding of the parts and interfaces that your computer has. We will not cover all
        possible parts in this lesson since you will learn more specific things naturally as we go through the course.</p>
    <h2>Input Devices</h2> Personal computers usually have at least one way to get information from the user to the
    machine. On your laptop, you probably use two all the time, although there are more that we can't cover in this
    lesson. <h3 id="checkpoint-1-keyboards">Checkpoint 1: Keyboards</h3>
    <p>This is probably the one you use the most. The keyboard allows the user to send information to the computer
        using electrical signals. Most laptop keyboards use a butterfly mechanism which takes up little space but can
        feel "mushy" when pressed. Larger keyboards often use rubber membranes inside to make the keys springy. These
        tend to be thicker than laptop keyboards. Some large keyboards are mechanical, meaning there is a vertical
        switch that is activated by pressing down on them. These mechanical keyboards tend to be very loud, but are
        easier to type on.</p>
    <p>Keyboards also come in different layouts and languages. The most common keyboard layout for English users is
        QWERTY. Why do you think this layout is called QWERTY?</p>
    <img alt="This is one type of QWERTY keyboard." title="This is
        one type of QWERTY keyboard." src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/QWERTY_keyboard_diagram.svg/800px-QWERTY_keyboard_diagram.svg.png"
        height="254" width="800">
    <p>Many computers come with bilingual keyboards. Some keyboards have a number pad while others do not. There are
        also different layouts like DVORAK.</p>
    <img alt="This is a DVORAK keyboard layout." title="This is a DVORAK
      keyboard layout." src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Dvorak_keyboard_layout_diagram.png/800px-Dvorak_keyboard_layout_diagram.png"
        height="241" width="800">
    <p>Find out how to set up your keyboard layout and language for your operating system. What language and layout
        does your computer use by default? Be as specific as possible.</p>

    <h3 id="checkpoint-2-mice-pens-and-touchpads">Checkpoint 2: Mice, Pens, and Touchpads</h3>
    <p>Early personal computers had only a keyboard. Eventually the mouse was developed to allow the user to interact
        with graphical user interfaces more naturally. Many people consider the mouse to be an improvement over
        keyboard-only interaction, although it did make operating systems much more complex. The first mice had wheels
        on the bottom. Then mice had a ball on the bottom which was easier to move. Most mice today use an optical
        sensor that doesn't move to track the motion of the mouse.</p>

        height="450" frameborder="0">
    </iframe>
    <p>Some early computers and many modern ones also allow the user to interact with the computer using a pen or
        stylus. One of the earliest examples of pen input on a computer was the Elliot Light Pen. Pens were very
        familiar for users and are still very popular with artists and engineers for communicating information with
        computers.</p>

    <p>Most laptops feature a touchpad (which is also called a trackpad) which is more compact than a mouse and can fit
        more easily into the flat shape of a laptop. Touchpads have become more sophisticated over time and now allow
        multi-touch, gestures, and even offer haptic feedback.</p>
    <p>Be prepared to answer the following questions:</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
        <li>When was the first computer mouse invented?</li>
        <li>Who invented the computer mouse?</li>
        <li>What form of input is popular with designers and artists?</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 id="checkpoint-3-microphone">Checkpoint 3: Microphone</h3>
    <p>Many laptops and tablets have microphones, and some desktops have them as well. In the past, these were usually
        used to send audio information to the computer for recording or sending to another person. However, more and
        more computers allow you to interact with the computer itself using audio. This is especially important if you
        aren't able to use more traditional forms of input because of a physical disability. Use your voice to input
        information into a device in this room.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint.</p>
    <h3 id="checkpoint-4-camera">Checkpoint 4: Camera</h3>
    <p>Like microphones, most computers used cameras to store information or send information to other users. However,
        computers are able to use cameras for user interaction as well. Windows 10 allows users to login by looking at
        the webcam to verify their identity, and there are applications that allow users to gesture to their computer's
        camera to perform different tasks. Give me an example of a way you could, or wish you could, interact with your
        computer using the camera.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint.</p>
    <h3 id="checkpoint-5-touchscreens">Checkpoint 5: Touchscreens</h3>
    <p>Because smartphones and tablets are so common now, we are used to touchscreens as a form of user input.
        Touchscreens have existed for many years, but they've become more sophisticated.</p>
    <p>The first touchscreens were resistive. They worked by sensing electrical signals generated by pressing the outer
        layer of the screen against the inner layer, which completed a circuit.</p>
    <p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Resistive_touchscreen2.jpg/799px-Resistive_touchscreen2.jpg" /><br />
        <em>Image Credit:</em> <em><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Resistive_touchscreen2.jpg">Szente</a></em></p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
        <li>Flexible transparent surface</li>
        <li>Transparent conductive layer</li>
        <li>Non-conductive spacer dots</li>
        <li>Empty space</li>
        <li>Glass</li>
        <li>LCD</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Resistive screens are not very precise without some sort of stylus, although they're still used in situations
        where the user would wear thick gloves since they don't need an electrical current from the user's finger to
        sense touch.</p>
    <p>Capacitive screens use the electrical field of your skin to tell where you are pressing on the screen. If you
        hold a smartphone or tablet up to bright light at an angle, you can usually see a grid of lines or dots. Each
        of these sensors measures electrical fields. The stronger the field, the more likely it is that you're touching
        that part of the screen. However, these screens do not work as well with gloves, and they do not work
        underwater.</p>
    <p>Ask Mr. Olinda for the PocketCHIP and a tablet. Determine what type of touchscreen each one has by testing them
        with different objects.</p>

    <h3 id="checkpoint-6-motion-control">Checkpoint 6: Motion Control</h3>

    <p>This form of input is becoming more common as virtual reality systems mature. You're probably most familiar with
        motion control from systems like the Nintendo Wii or smartphones and tablets. However, laptops and desktops can
        also use these forms of input. What kind of job or task would be easier to do with motion control than with one
        of the other forms of input?</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint.</p>
    <h2 id="output-devices">Output Devices</h2>
    <p>Computers must be able to accept input from users, but it's just as important for them to be able to get
        information back to the user. We're going to cover the most common methods.</p>
    <h3 id="checkpoint-7-screens">Checkpoint 7: Screens</h3>
    <p>Believe it or not, the first computers had neither screens nor keyboards. You got information in and out using
        switches, punch cards, or printouts. Screens allowed the computer to display information and update it quickly
        for the user. This made working with text and images much easier since the user could see their changes live
        instead of waiting for the machine to print out the work.</p>
    <p>Screens were first based on cathode-ray tubes which charged the surface of the screen, causing phosphors in the
        screen to glow based on electrical current. The screen used a large magnet in the back of the screen to aim the
        charging beam, moving rapidly from one side to the other, top to bottom.</p>
    <p>Liquid crystal displays use a layer of crystals suspended in fluid that rotate based on charge. Each pixel
        contains several crystals which can be rotated independently, allowing various amounts of light and color
        through from the light behind the screen. A more modern form of screen is the organic light emitting diode,
        which allows the pixels to produce the light, instead of simply allowing it through the screen.</p>
    <p>What type of screen does your computer use?</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint.</p>
    <h3 id="checkpoint-8-speakers">Checkpoint 8: Speakers</h3>
    <p>Computers can use sound to transmit information to the user. We usually use this to listen to music or videos,
        but computers also use sound to communicate information to the user about the computer itself. See if you can
        get your computer to respond to your input using sound. For example, computers often warn the user of an error
        using sound.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint.</p>
    <h3 id="checkpoint-9-haptics">Checkpoint 9: Haptics</h3>
    <p>Some computers and tablets and almost all phones use some sort of haptic feedback, such as vibration, to
        communicate information to the user. For example, your phone can vibrate continuously to let you know you have
        a phone call, vibrate in pulses for text messages, and vibrate once for a Facebook notification. What is a way
        your computer could use haptic feedback to communicate with you? What are the advantages of haptic feedback
        instead of audio or visual feedback?</p>

    <h2 id="ports-and-data-transfer">Ports and Data Transfer</h2>
    <h3 id="checkpoint-10-power">Checkpoint 10: Power</h3>
    <p>Most computers, especially desktops, don't send data through the same port they use for power (unlike phones).
        This port allows the computer to draw power from another source to either run the computer, charge the battery,
        or both. There are some universal shapes and sizes of ports, although some laptops have ports that are unique
        to prevent them from being used with other chargers or cables.</p>
    <p>Where is the power port on your computer? Take a close look at it and see what it looks like on the inside. See
        if you can find a device in the room that has a different type of power port than your computer.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint.</p>
    <h3 id="checkpoint-11-usb">Checkpoint 11: USB</h3>
    <p>USB stands for universal serial bus. Most computers, tablets, and phones use USB ports to receive and send
        information to other devices. There are five major types of USB ports you will see on a regular basis. I've
        organized them based on physical appearance, not speed. Unfortunately the classification of USB types is very
        confusing, and you can refer to a full list here if you want more specific information. The letter usually
        refers to the shape of the connector, while the number refers to the speed. On a laptop, you can usually tell
        if a port is USB 3.0 or higher because it will have a small <em>SS</em> next to it or the inside of the port
        will be blue.</p>
    <p><strong>USB A</strong> is the connector you see on most computers. It is rectangular and one half contains a
        plastic tab. This connector has been used with USB 1, 2, and 3, and all three are cross-compatible, although
        they'll only work at the speed of the slowest part, whether that is the port or the cable.</p>
    <p><strong>USB B</strong> is often used on printers, scanners, and other accessories. It is square and hollow on
        the inside. You'll also see it on the Arduino units we work with later this year. USB B also has been used with
        USB 1, 2, and 3, but most cables with USB B are USB A on the other end.</p>
    <p><strong>Mini USB</strong> is shaped like a flattened T and is often seen on external hard drives and older
        phones. It's much smaller than USB A or USB B but has the same capabilities. The A and B versions of Mini USB
        are very similar in shape. However, Mini USB is not supposed to be used on new devices anymore so it will
        become less and less common. It does not come in a USB 3 version.</p>
    <p><strong>Micro USB</strong> is probably the connector you use most other than USB A. Micro USB A is very thin and
        rectangular, while Micro USB B is very thin and rectangular, but has truncated top corners. Micro USB comes in
        USB 1, 2, and 3 versions, although Micro USB 3.0 had an extra section on the side. Samsung's Galaxy S phones
        used this type of connector briefly. There's also a reversible version of the Micro USB connector in which all
        four corners are truncated.</p>
    <p><strong>USB C</strong> is the newest type of connector and is rectangular with rounded ends. It's about the same
        size as Micro USB but is completely reversible and supports many more functions, higher speeds, and power
        outputs.</p>
    <p>Take a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#Connector_types">look at Wikipedia's summary of connector
            types</a> and see if you can find pictures of each of the connectors. That will help you answer the
        following questions.</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
        <li>What types of connectors and speeds do the USB ports on your computer support?</li>
        <li>What kind of connector is used by the PocketCHIP?</li>
        <li>What about the tablets?</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint.</p>
    <h3 id="checkpoint-12-ethernet">Checkpoint 12: Ethernet</h3>
    <p>Many laptops no longer have an Ethernet port, but most desktops do. The connector is called an RJ-45, and the
        cable is called an Ethernet cable. It contains eight wires inside the outer cover, and each of those eight
        wires can carry data. The most common use for Ethernet is connecting different parts of a network. However, you
        can also use them for power, USB connections, and other things if you are feeling creative. The Ethernet port
        on your computer can transmit as much as 1,000,000,000 bits of information per second, but there are versions
        of Ethernet that are 100 times faster than that.</p>
    <p>Does your computer have an Ethernet port? If not, find a computer that does. Practice plugging the RJ-45
        connector in and removing it. Note that you have to press down on the lever on the top to remove it.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint.</p>
    <h3 id="checkpoint-13-audio">Checkpoint 13: Audio</h3>
    <p>There are several ways to get audio in and out of a computer via ports. The most obvious solution is the 3.5mm
        headphone jack, although some computers have a separate 3.5mm microphone jack, and others have a combined 3.5mm
        headphone/microphone jack.</p>
    <p>However, you can also use <a href="http://www.edn.com/Pdf/ViewPdf?contentItemId=4376143">USB</a>, HDMI,
        (mini)Displayport, and Thunderbolt to receive and transmit audio. You can also transmit audio over a Bluetooth
        wireless connection.</p>
    <p>Open Audacity and check out the different inputs and outputs for audio on your computer. Most computers will
        have at least two methods of sending and receiving audio.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint.</p>
    <h3 id="checkpoint-14-video">Checkpoint 14: Video</h3>
    <p>You computer probably has at least one way to get video out to another screen. On most computers this is now the
        HDMI port, although larger computers also have a VGA port. However, you can also use <a href="http://www.edn.com/Pdf/ViewPdf?contentItemId=4376143">USB</a>,
        (mini)Displayport, and Thunderbolt to receive and transmit audio. You can also transmit video wirelessly
        through systems like WiDi, Miracast, and Chromecast. Take a look at one of the other computers and identify the
        ports that can transmit video</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint.</p>
    <h3 id="checkpoint-15-optical-drives">Checkpoint 15: Optical Drives</h3>
    <p>Optical drives are any drives that read CDs, DVDs, Blu-Rays or other forms of media that use a laser to read the
        disk. If your computer has an optical drive, open it and take a look at the inside. Look at (but do not touch)
        the internal parts and see if you can identify the laser and the mechanism for it to move inside the drive. If
        you can't find it, look up pictures.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint.</p>
    <h3 id="checkpoint-16-internal-components">Checkpoint 16: Internal Components</h2>
        <p>Once you open up the chassis (the frame of the computer that holds all the internal and external components
            together) you'll see a number of large parts inside the computer. Look up the following components and then
            try to identify them on the class computers with Mr. Olinda:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
            <li>Motherboard</li>
            <li>Central Processing Unit</li>
            <li>Power Supply</li>
            <li>Random Access Memory</li>
            <li>Hard disk drive or solid state drive</li>
        </ol>

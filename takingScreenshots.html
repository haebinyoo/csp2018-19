    <p>You'll have to take screenshots of your work throughout this course, so it's important to learn how to do it
        quickly and correctly. The lab computers have ShareX installed to supplement the tools built into Windows. Make
        sure ShareX is running by going to the Start Menu and opening it.</p>
    <h2>Checkpoint 1: Full Screen</h2>
    <p>Take a screenshot of your entire screen by pressing the <span class="keyboardShortcut">Print Screen</span>
        button on your keyboard. Find the file in your ShareX folder.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint.</p>
    <h2>Checkpoint 2: Selection</h2>
    <p>Take a screenshot of only part of your screen by pressing <span class="keyboardShortcut">Control-Print Screen</span>
        and clicking and dragging to select a region. Find the file in your ShareX folder.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint.</p>
    <h2>Checkpoint 3: Window</h2>
    <p>Open Windows Explorer and then screenshot only that window by pressing <span class="keyboardShortcut">Control-Print
            Screen</span> and then hovering over that window and clicking. Find the file in your ShareX folder.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint.</p>
    <h2>Checkpoint 4: Full Screen Recording</h2>
    <p>Press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Shift-Print Screen</span> and make sure you select the entire screen. If it
        asks you to install FFMPEG, do so. Record your screen for five to ten seconds and then press Shift-Print Screen
        again. Find the file in your ShareX folder.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify this checkpoint.</p>
    <h2>Checkpoint 5: Partial Screen Recording</h2>
    <p>Press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Shift-Print Screen</span> and make sure you select only a part of your
        screen. Record your selection for five to ten seconds and then press <span class="keyboardShortcut">Shift-Print
            Screen</span> again. Find the file in your ShareX folder.</p>
